## Install
The easiest way to install the LedFx integration is with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). First install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) if you don’t have it yet. After installation you can find this integration in the [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) store under integrations.

Alternatively, you can install it manually. Just copy and paste the content of the hass-ledfx/custom_components folder in your config/custom_components directory. As example, you will get the sensor.py file in the following path: /config/custom_components/ledfx/sensor.py. The disadvantage of a manual installation is that you won’t be notified about updates.

## Config
**Via GUI**

`Settings` > `Integrations` > `Plus` > `LedFx`

To connect, enter the ip address and port. And also if you use basic auth, enter the user and password.

❗ Via YAML (legacy way) not supported
